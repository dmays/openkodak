Looking into customizing the firmware of Kodak's HD pocket cameras.  Specifically the Zi6, Zi8, and the Zx1.  The purpose is to add features to the camera and unlock it's full potential.

So far, this whole project is just about collecting information.  If you have older firmwares, let me know so that I can make them available here.

Note:  I am not a programmer, hardware hacker, or magic genie of any kind.  If you have any skills that would help this project along and are willing to help out, please let me know.  Thanks!
